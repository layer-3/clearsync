# Clearing Network (Clearnet)

Yellow network is isolated into three networks, development, pre-production and production.
The development is a fully locally deployed environment and stage environment connected to the privately deployed blockchain.
The test environment is a canary network, which means we will be using real assets
and real value locked to have a better feedback on vulnerabilities.

The development flow is expected to be the following: Localnet -> Stagenet -> Canarynet -> Mainnet

Note: the localnet expects a locally deployed blockchain node with generated new assets address each time, and stagenet connecting to the private node with limited access.
