# Quotes service

The Quotes Service is a centralized system responsible for recording and disseminating real-time trade data 
from various trading platforms.

Available drivers:
- Binance
- Kraken
- Opendax
- Bitfaker
- Uniswap v3
  - based on Subgraph API
  - based on go-ethereum
- Syncswap

## Interface to connect

```go
type Driver interface {
	Start() error
	Stop() error
	Subscribe(market Market) error
	Unsubscribe(market Market) error
}
```

## Type of price source

| Top Tier CEX | Altcoins CEX | FIAT       | DEX         |
|--------------|--------------|------------|-------------|
| BitFinex     | Gate         | UpBit      | Sushi       |
| OKX          | MEXC         | Kraken     | PancakeSwap |
| Binance      | KuCoin       | Coinbase   | Uniswap     |
| weight: 20   | weight: 5    | weight: 15 | weight: 50  |

## Last Price

For candle sticks, Recent trade, tickers last price is calculated as follows:

```
last_price = price
```

## Index Price

Used mainly in risk management for portfolio evaluation:

```
index_price = EMA20(price x ( trade_size x weight / active_weights ))
# active_weight being the sum of weight where this market exists (ex: KuCoin:5 + uniswap:50)
# EMA20 is likely 20 at 1 min scale
```

## How Uniswap adapter calculates swap price

### Method 1: from sqrtPriceX96

#### Motivation

Uniswap V3 uses [Q notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(number_format)), which is a type of fixed-point arithmetics, to encode swap price.
 
Q notation allows variables to remain integers, but function similarly to floating point numbers.
Additionally piping the price through square root allows to reduce dimentionality of the number.
Predictable size of the number encoded this way enables efficient caching and fast retrieval of data from chain.

#### How to calculate price?

Actually this is a two step process:
1. Decode price
2. Convert the price into wei/wei ratio

##### Step 1

Here's the formula:
```
sqrtPrice = sqrtPriceX96 / (2^96)
price = sqrtPrice^2
```

##### Step 2

ERC20 tokens have built in decimal values.
For example, 1 WETH actually represents WETH in the contract whereas USDC is 10^6.
USDC has 6 decimals and WETH has 18.
So the price calculated on step 1 actually depicts [wei of token0] / [unit token of token1].
Now let's convert that into [wei] / [wei] ratio:

```
price0 = price / (10^(decimal1-decimal0))
price1 = 1 / price0
```

### Method 2: ticks

This method requires a different set of inputs to calculate.

#### Motivation

Ticks are related directly to price and enable simpler calculations compared to [[#Method 1]].
This requires just a tick value and a one-shot formula.

#### How to calculate price?

To convert from tick t, to price, take 1.0001^t to get the corresponding price.

```
price  = 1.0001^tick
price0 = price / (10^(decimal1-decimal0))
price1 = 1 / price0
```

It's also possible to convert sqrtPriceX96 to tick:
```
tick = floor[ log((sqrtPriceX96 / (2^96))^2) / log(1.0001) ]
```
