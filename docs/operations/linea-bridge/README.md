# Linea Bridge

[Official Linea Token Bridge](https://bridge.linea.build/) supports either [Vanilla ERC20](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-contracts/blob/3cf85529fd4539eb06ba998030c37e47f98c528a/contracts/tokenBridge/BridgedToken.sol) or Custom ERC20 tokens. The latter is the case only after direct integration with the Linea Bridge team.
