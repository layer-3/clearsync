# Solidity API

## TestERC20

### constructor

```solidity
constructor(string name_, string symbol_, uint256 cap_) public
```

### mint

```solidity
function mint(address account, uint256 amount) external virtual
```

### decimals

```solidity
function decimals() public view virtual returns (uint8)
```

\_Returns the number of decimals used to get its user representation.
For example, if `decimals` equals `2`, a balance of `505` tokens should
be displayed to a user as `5.05` (`505 / 10 ** 2`).

Tokens usually opt for a value of 18, imitating the relationship between
Ether and Wei. This is the value {ERC20} uses, unless this function is
overridden;

NOTE: This information is only used for _display_ purposes: it in
no way affects any of the arithmetic of the contract, including
{IERC20-balanceOf} and {IERC20-transfer}.\_
