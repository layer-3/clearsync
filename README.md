## DUCKIES as a canary network of YELLOW

### What is a canary network?

Canary networks inherited their name after the historical usage of canaries in the coal mines. Like brave little birds being great early detectors, Duckies network acts as a pioneering development playground where Yellow experiments with technologies and gathers real usersâ€˜ feedback in fast-paced, dynamic conditions.
Duckies network is a living platform that tests next-gen tech and functionality under the most realistic conditions before they are integrated into Yellow Network.
