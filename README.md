# Yellow Clearing Network

This repository contains the smart contracts of the [Yellow Network](https://www.yellow.org).

Yellow Network is a Layer-3 peer-to-peer network that uses [State Channels](https://statechannels.org/) technology to scale and facilitate trading, clearing and settlement. The core technology is called ClearSync.

In this system, participants of ClearSync can create and fund a state channel, which is a private communication channel between two parties that allows for off-chain transactions to occur. This means that transactions are not recorded on the main Ethereum blockchain until the channel is closed, which helps to reduce congestion and increase transaction speed for High-frequency trading.

### ClearSync Architecture

![contract architecture](docs/media/architecture.png)

### Project purpose

In traditional finance, clearing denotes all activities from the time a commitment is made for a transaction until it is settled. Yellow Network facilitate the scaling of trading between crypto-currency exchanges by interconnecting them through a simple clearing protocol called ClearSync.

### Business use cases

#### Inter-Exchange trading

Yellow Network has been initially created to facilitate medium sized crypto-currency exchange to access a global liquidity network. Similarly to [ECN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_communication_network) in traditional finance but as a decentralized [mesh network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking).

At present, small and medium-sized brokers face difficulty in obtaining liquidity due to the lack of clearing systems or prime brokers. As a result, these businesses often have to depend on their own market-making trading bots, which can be a costly undertaking in terms of capital pre-funding. Furthermore, moving customer deposits on third-party exchanges also carries a non-trivial settlement counter-party risk.

#### Algo-Trading Firms and Market Makers

Trading companies can leverage a global network to position their servers in the most optimal location with respect to liquidity volumes. By utilizing Yellow Network's cloud architecture, these firms can benefit from reduced infrastructure and operational costs.

Furthermore, since Yellow Network doesn't require pre-funding of traded assets, trading firms can enhance their capital efficiency and gain access to a broader range of market opportunities.

#### Day Traders

For day traders, it is possible to open a few channels at the start of the trading day and execute all their trades in bulk until they are ready to settle on-chain. This approach helps day traders to optimize their capital usage by keeping their funds available for the most critical trading opportunities.

### Performance requirements

In ClearSync all transactions occur off-chain, the decentralized clearing using state-channels is able to achieve high throughput and low latency, making it a scalable and efficient solution for centralized (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on the Ethereum network but not limited to.

ClearSync MUST be able to fund and defund channels under few minutes, it's expected that those direct channels (on-chain funded) lifespan is several weeks.

When parties are off-chains communication must be low latency and capable of high-frequency, Margin-Request may occur several times per minutes, while proprietary trading protocol might be under 100 ms scale and capable of thousands of requests per seconds.

## Usage

```bash
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

## Deployments

### Test Network

Goerli and Mumbai are used for development and test environment. The community of early adopter from Duckies may be invited for Gorilla test sessions through [testnet.yellow.org](testnet.yellow.org)

### Canary Network

Duckies is the **canary network for Yellow**, for testing ClearSync technology in a live environment prior to deployment on mainnet. New network participant must deploy first on the Canary Network before rolling out to the mainnet.

Duckies ERC20 token and ClearSync is deployed on Polygon mainnet.

### Main Networks

The first network for YELLOW ERC20 and ClearSync system will be on Ethereum mainnet, but the system can be extended later to Layer-2, Solana, or using a Polkadot parachain.

## Smart Contracts

### contracts/Token.sol

This smart contract is the ERC20 used by both YELLOW and DUCKIES tokens. The YELLOW token is collateral to open a state channel with another network entity. Additionally, it is used to pay the settlement fees on the network.

### contracts/duckies/

The smart contracts in this directory are specific to DUCKIES and include features unique to the Duckies sub-project. These features are designed to promote user engagement within the YELLOW community, particularly during the development phase of the Yellow network, and are related to the Duckies game and reward program.
